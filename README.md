# ðŸ¦€ Learn Rust

A repo to track the resources I'm using to learn Rust. This includes:
- examples from the ([interactive](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)) [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/),
- the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises, and
- working through [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Rust.
